**NEW:** I added 2 other clones of 4294967296 - [9007199254740992 - Size 32](https://rawgit.com/TheAstronomer/2147483648/size32/index.html) and [8589934592 - Animated Edition](https://rawgit.com/TheAstronomer/2147483648/master/index.html). The first one can support grid sizes up to 32x32, and the second one has cooler designs and animated tiles! I also added Lucas numbers (2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76...) and Troll mode (moves in random directions whenever you make a move) to the game and it is available on all 4294967296  sites. The game has been modified for endless gameplay too!

***Update***: Added 2048 Chemistry variants, in which two adjacent tiles with the same element can merge to form a tile of the next element. For example, two Selenium (Se) tiles can merge to form a Bromine (Br) tile.

The 4 new elements renamed 2 years ago are: 
* **Nihonium** and symbol **Nh**, for the element 113,
* **Moscovium** and symbol **Mc**, for the element 115,
* **Tennessine** and symbol **Ts**, for the element 117, and
* **Oganesson** and symbol **Og**, for the element 118.

Previous update: Minor text fixes on some games.

More tile themes will be added (Divergent Factions cum Pokemon Go Teams, and two more colors, totalling 24), and three more 2048 modes - Scratch, TPSS@30 (in commemoration of my secondary school, Tampines Secondary) and iPlay2048!

## Project work?
I made this in my spare time, and it's hosted on GitHub, which means there are no hosting costs.

Enjoy the game!
